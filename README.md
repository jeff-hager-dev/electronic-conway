# Conway's Game of life in Electron

## Why

Because I wanted to

Yes, I know I could have done this with Canvas or other web techs but I wanted to see if I could do it with Angular.


## Running

```npm start``` is the main command I use to run this application. It does two things. First it runs ```gulp build``` then ```electron main.js``` to actually start the electron application

## Developing

TODO
